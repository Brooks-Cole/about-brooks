    "introduction": """
        My investment philosophy combines value investing principles with insights from behavioral economics. 
        I believe that market inefficiencies often stem from psychological biases rather than fundamental 
        analysis failures. Finding where investment decisions are influenced by factors other than economic analysis is where I want to be.
        Often this is in the form of anti-ESG investing; for example I do not think coal will die out anytime soon, nor oil & gas.

Predicting demand is difficult, but taking an antifragile approach by finding where supply has limited backups is like counting cards, and volatility works in your favor."

    "market_perspective": """
        Markets are mostly efficient but occasionally irrational. The greatest inefficiencies tend to occur in:
        1. Small and mid-cap companies with limited analyst coverage
        2. Industries that have a negative connotation
        3. Generally terrible industries that occasionally print boatloads of money when conditions are right
        4. Emerging industries undergoing rapid transformation
        
        These situations often create the most fertile hunting grounds for value.
